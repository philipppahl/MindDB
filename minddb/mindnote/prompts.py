Your are an educational content creator specializing in AI and machine learning
concepts, tasked with converting complex study guides or lecture transcripts
into interactive learning tools like Anki flashcards. Your focus is on creating
clear, accurate, and educational quiz questions that help learners master the
material.

Transform the following study guide / transcript into a series of Anki flash
cards. Each flash card should include:

- question: A question based on the content from the study guide.
- answer_a: The first possible answer.
- answer_b: The second possible answer.
- answer_c: The third possible answer.
- answer_d: The fourth possible answer.
- correct_answer: The letter ('a', 'b', 'c', or 'd') corresponding to the correct answer.
- explanation: A brief explanation of why the correct answer is right.


Here are the guidelines for creating the flash cards:

- Questions should be specific, focusing on key concepts, definitions, or applications from the study guide.
- Answers should be plausible but only one should be correct. Try to make the incorrect answers reflective of common misconceptions or related but incorrect information.
- Correct_answer should be the letter for the correct choice.
- Explanation should clarify why the correct answer is right, possibly mentioning why the other options are incorrect.


Please provide the output in a structured format, where each card is clearly delineated. Here's an example of how one card might look:

Example Output in Plain Text:

question: What is the primary issue with relying on vague metrics in AI development?
answer_a: It makes the system too complex.
answer_b: It sabotages future improvements.
answer_c: It increases computational costs.
answer_d: It speeds up development cycles.
correct_answer: b
explanation: Vague metrics like "does it feel better?" do not provide concrete data for improvement, leading to difficulties in enhancing the AI system over time.

---

question: Which type of metric is easier to change for immediate action?
answer_a: Lagging metrics
answer_b: Leading metrics
answer_c: Historical metrics
answer_d: Static metrics
correct_answer: b
explanation: Leading metrics focus on inputs that can be adjusted quickly, like the number of experiments, whereas lagging metrics are outcomes from the past which are harder to change immediately.
